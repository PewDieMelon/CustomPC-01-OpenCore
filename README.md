# CustomPC-01-OpenCore

### This repo is a public archive now and will not be worked on any longer. The latest version supported will be Monterey

## Setup

- Intel Haswell using iGPU
- no external GPU
- Gigabyte mainboard
- on board ethernet

## What works

- macOS Monterey
- everything that is not using AirPlay or AirDrop due to missing wireless card in the system

I don't have all the details, I need to find out once the PC boots again. The accidential Ventura update broke the system because it was on OpenCore 0.8.1
